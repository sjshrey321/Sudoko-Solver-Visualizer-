# Sudoku-Solver

This is a simple implementation of the classic Sudoku game using the Tkinter library in Python.
Prerequisites

Before you run the program, make sure you have the following:

    Python 3 installed on your computer.
    The Tkinter library installed (it should be included with Python by default).
    The sudoku.py file downloaded to your computer.

How to Run the Program

To run the program, navigate to the directory where you saved the sudoku.py file using the command line, then run the following command:

python sudoku.py

Alternatively, you can run the program by double-clicking on the file if you have a Python interpreter installed.
How to Play

The game board is a 9x9 grid of squares, with some squares initially filled in with numbers. The goal of the game is to fill in the remaining squares with numbers so that each row, column, and 3x3 sub-grid contains all of the digits from 1 to 9.

To play, simply click on a square to select it, then type a number on your keyboard to enter it into the square.

To erase a number, simply select the square and press the Backspace or Delete key on your keyboard.
